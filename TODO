add check_rpm_not_installed()

we often have:
if server_XXX:
	check_copy("YYY", "/etc/cron/YYY")
else:
	check_not_exists("/etc/cron/YYY")
To fix this, add an only_if optional argument to check_copy, which if
true will act as a copy, and if false will act as a check_not_exists.

When deleting things in directories older than a certain date, add a
keep_at_least argument to keep at least that many things in the
directory, and do deletes oldest-first.

Add PID to syslog logging, so lines start with pysysconf[PID]:

Add check_rpm_not_installed (for core_programs).

Add service_exists/double_check_service_disabled (run_pysysconf).
