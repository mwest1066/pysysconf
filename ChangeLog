0.2.7

	- Log when removing files with check_not_exists()

	- Fixed bug where check_link() would fail if the destination
	  already existed, due to the variable "backup" being undefined.

0.2.6 2005-11-05

	- Added a test_regexp class to enable check_not_exists by
	  filename regexp match.

	- Changed default argument "backup" to check_not_exists() to
	  default to False.

	- Altered aquire_lock() to write the pid of the process into
	  the lockfile. If the lockfile already exists, then the pid
	  is read and if that process doesn't exist then the lockfile
	  is forcibly removed. This should fix the problem where a
	  crash of pysysconf would require manual lockfile removal.

	- Removed classes support, as it's easier to just define boolean
	  variables directly.

	- Added GPL header and LICENSE file.

0.2.5 2005-03-10

	- Log no action if a check_not_exist already doesn't exist.

	- Split ChangeLog out of README into separate file.

	- Print PysysconfError exception information correctly.

0.2.4 2005-03-09 17:23

	- Remove input_dir variable. Should be set by
	  user scripts if needed.

	- Fix check_service_status so that needs_restart
	  and needs_reload are passed to check_service_enabled.

0.2.3 2005-02-16 15:35

	- Add the check_service_status command.
