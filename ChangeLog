0.3.6 XXXX-XX-XX

	- Fixed bogus reporting of "did not have any removals" when
	check_not_exists() is called with a test parameter and files were
	in fact removed.
	
0.3.5 2010-03-07

	- Added check_rpm_not_installed() function and added more logging
	to check_rpm_installed().

0.3.4 2009-11-20

	- Added service_exists() function and modified
	check_service_enabled(), check_service_disabled(), and
	check_service_status() to use it, so they will run without error
	even when the service is not present.

0.3.3 2009-10-06

	- Changed PysysconfException to LOG_ERROR for test-based deletion
	on non-directories.

	- Check whether SELinux is enabled before trying to get or set
	SELinux booleans.

0.3.2 2009-07-10

	- Use filecmp module to compare files rather than computing md5
	  sums. This removes the deprecation warning for the md5 module
	  with python 2.6.

	- Fix acquire_lock() to actually work in the case that the
	  lockfile already exists and the process using it is still
	  running, and also to work without calling "ps" by using the
	  builtin function os.getsid().

0.3.1 2009-06-11

	- Update to python 2.6

0.3.0 2009-03-23

	- Added SELinux support to set file contexts and booleans.

	- Fix return value and stat data setting for _copy_dir in the case
	  that the source is an empty directory.

	- Make most arguments of _copy_dir, _chkstat, and _chkstatsrc
	  non-optional.

0.2.8 2007-07-02

	- Update to python 2.5

0.2.7 2005-11-19

	- Log when removing files with check_not_exists()

	- Fixed bug where check_link() would fail if the destination
	  already existed, due to the variable "backup" being undefined.

0.2.6 2005-11-05

	- Added a test_regexp class to enable check_not_exists by
	  filename regexp match.

	- Changed default argument "backup" to check_not_exists() to
	  default to False.

	- Altered aquire_lock() to write the pid of the process into
	  the lockfile. If the lockfile already exists, then the pid
	  is read and if that process doesn't exist then the lockfile
	  is forcibly removed. This should fix the problem where a
	  crash of pysysconf would require manual lockfile removal.

	- Removed classes support, as it's easier to just define boolean
	  variables directly.

	- Added GPL header and LICENSE file.

0.2.5 2005-03-10

	- Log no action if a check_not_exist already doesn't exist.

	- Split ChangeLog out of README into separate file.

	- Print PysysconfError exception information correctly.

0.2.4 2005-03-09 17:23

	- Remove input_dir variable. Should be set by
	  user scripts if needed.

	- Fix check_service_status so that needs_restart
	  and needs_reload are passed to check_service_enabled.

0.2.3 2005-02-16 15:35

	- Add the check_service_status command.
